Archinsight project tends to implement architecture-as-code definition of a standard c4 architecture model.
This project offers a new Insight language designed in such way that an Architect can focus on architecture
definition, not visualization.
<br>
Compared to UML, the Insight language is more specific and is unable to describe
an arbitrary entity, but shorter and probably easier to use.
<br>
Unlike other UML software, such as PlantUML, Archinsight would offer it's user:
<ul>
    <li>A specific Insight language to describe c4 model</li>
    <li>Model integrity check with linker</li>
    <li>Model interactivity</li>
    <li>Architecture introspections from highest to lowest level in one place</li>
</ul>
